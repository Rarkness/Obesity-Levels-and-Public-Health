# **Project Overview**

As part of the Data Science Certificate program at the University of Toronto‚Äôs Data Sciences Institute, we selected the Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition dataset and conducted a compelling study on which lifestyle factors have the greatest impact on obesity levels, applying the analytical and technical skills we developed throughout the course.
This study offers practical advice for public health authorities, health and wellness providers, and insurers looking to address obesity-related risks.
This business case proposes using a validated dataset and analytical models to accurately estimate and predict obesity levels based on eating habits, physical conditions and other factors.

# **Introduction**

Obesity is an escalating global health issue that significantly contributes to a range of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It is also associated with reduced life expectancy and leads to increased healthcare expenditures due to the need for long-term management of obesity-related conditions. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving public health outcomes and reducing the economic burden on healthcare systems.<br>

This business case delves into the promising application of the dataset titled "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition." By utilizing this comprehensive dataset, we aim to develop sophisticated predictive models that can accurately estimate obesity levels based on individuals' eating habits and physical conditions. These models will provide valuable insights to inform public health strategies and initiatives.<br>

With the integration of data analytics, we can enhance the effectiveness of public health campaigns by targeting specific populations at risk of obesity and tailoring interventions accordingly. Furthermore, this dataset can be leveraged to personalize health interventions, offering customized recommendations and support to individuals striving to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 
Our primary objective is to harness the power of data to improve the prediction and prevention of obesity. By doing so, we hope to foster a healthier society, extend life expectancy, and alleviate the financial strain on healthcare systems worldwide.

# **Problem Statement**
 
Obesity affects millions worldwide, raising healthcare costs, reducing productivity, and increasing the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Traditional methods, like self-reports and BMI, often miss key factors. A data-driven approach that considers eating habits, physical activity, and lifestyle offers a clearer picture. Early identification of risks can help individuals and organizations take proactive steps to improve health outcomes.

---
# **Business Goal**

üöÄ **Key Insight:**  What are the key lifestyle factors (e.g., eating habits, physical activity) that contribute most to obesity levels?

We aim to use data science to build a predictive model that estimates obesity levels based on eating habits and physical health. This kind of model can help healthcare providers, fitness companies, insurance firms, and policymakers take more targeted action when it comes to preventing obesity.

---
# **Expected Benefits**
 
It helps with the early detection of obesity risks, allowing for timely interventions that can reduce long-term healthcare costs. Insurance companies and corporate wellness programs can use it to categorize policyholders or employees by risk level, making health initiatives more targeted and effective. Healthcare providers can support preventive care and deliver personalized treatments, while governments and policymakers gain evidence-based insights to guide public health campaigns and shape policy. In the fitness and wellness space, it enhances personalized health plans, and for individuals, it provides valuable insights to make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle.

# **Data Science Approach**
 
We are adopting a structured Data Science Approach (DSA) to explore key lifestyle and demographic factors associated with obesity. The following outlines our initial plan, which will evolve as we continue to refine our methods and results.

### üîé Problem Understanding
We are in the process of clearly defining the problem, which focuses on predicting and analyzing obesity levels based on lifestyle behaviors and demographic factors. As we progress, we will continue to refine our understanding and focus areas.

### üéØ Business Goal
Our intended goal is to help wellness providers and organizations identify the most influential factors contributing to obesity. This will guide them in designing effective health interventions and personalized wellness programs. We will revisit and adjust these goals as we uncover insights.

### üìÇ Data Collection and Overview
We plan to use a widely recognized dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes synthetic data, designed to reflect real-world obesity trends while maintaining privacy. Our current focus is on understanding its structure, and we anticipate making further adjustments to how we preprocess and use the data.

### üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation
We have cleaning and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, and normalizing numerical features. This cleaning may evolve as we explore different preprocessing techniques and adapt our approach to improve model performance.

### ü§ñ Modeling Approach and Objectives
We intend to implement learning models, with an initial focus to predict obesity levels and analyze feature importance. These modeling choices are subject to change as we experiment with different algorithms and evaluate their performance.

### üìä Evaluation
We will evaluate our models using various metrics. Our evaluation strategy may be revised as we test different models and techniques to ensure robust and reliable outcomes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
Our plan includes deploying the final solution as a static dashboard, where users can explore obesity-related insights. The dashboard will be refined as we finalize our models and visualizations.

### üí° Results and Conclusions
Our conclusions and recommendations will be developed as we complete our analysis.

# **Cleaning the Data**

The original dataset is of good quality with no missing values. However, it contained 24 duplicate rows, likely from synthetic generation (77% via Weka and SMOTE). We removed these duplicates, retaining unique entries, to improve reliability while preserving completeness.

---
# **Proposed Solution**
 
The proposed solution uses the ‚ÄúDataset for estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition‚Äù to include visualizations to highlight the key factors that contribute most to obesity and develop a predictive model that classifies individuals into seven obesity levels. The process after data cleaning and preprocessing, identifys key factors such as diet quality, hydration, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and transport choices. The final step is creating an interactive tool or dashboard that delivers personalized health recommendations, targeted interventions, and easy monitoring for healthcare providers, fitness professionals, insurance companies, and policymakers.

# **Risks and Mitigations**
 
There are a few risks to consider, but each has a clear plan to address them. First is data quality, if the data is incomplete or inaccurate, it can lead to unreliable results. To avoid this, the data will go through rigorous cleaning and validation to ensure it‚Äôs consistent and accurate before analysis. Another risk is bias in the analysis, which can happen if the dataset isn‚Äôt diverse enough. To minimize this, the data will be carefully reviewed to make sure it includes a wide range of demographic and lifestyle factors, helping to produce fair and balanced insights. Privacy is also a major concern, especially when dealing with health-related data. To protect personal information, the project will follow strict data protection regulations and best practices, ensuring all data remains confidential and secure throughout the process.
